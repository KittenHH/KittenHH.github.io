As of writing this the Whatcom Transit Authority (WTA) is funded by a 0.03% sales tax. In order for the WTA to go fare free the amount of money received from taxes must increase. According to Community First Watcom’s research the city would need to make an extra 1.1 Million in tax revenue. There are a few different options the city can pursue to make the extra cash.
                       </p> <p style="line-height: 2;">  
The most optimal tax is a 10 dollar vehicle tab fee. Meaning that every year people whose cars are registered within Bellingham get charged 10 dollars a year to renew their vehicle tabs. This is the most ideal form of taxation since people who own cars on average have a higher income than people who are dependent on public transit to get around, and since only car owners are taxed it is the most progressive option. This is also the most politically viable since it would only require the approval of the city council which means the plan only needs to be approved by the five city council members.
